title: About me
---

I am 36 years old and am starting a new career.  I quit a civil service job of over 10 years to persue a passion I have in software development.  I am married to the greatest person on the planet, my best friend Erica.  We have four kids, a 13 year old, an 8 year old, and 3 year old twins.  Erica is a labor and delivery nurse, so she delievers babies all night long.  Needless to say our kids keep our life pretty busy and happy.  Other than that I love the Green Bay Packers, and pretty much anything food related, I am a foodie.
