title: Asking For Help
---
How we should ask questions with our work.  This could be easily apply in the work place, as well as in school.  Well, before we ask for help with something we are working on, we need to be prepared to answer a couple of questions.  First off, what are we trying to do with our code, second what did you expect would happen, and of course, third what did happen.  These questions arent meant to be snotty responses to pointless questions, but they are intended to encourage us to continue solving small problems ourselves.  There will obviously be problems and situations where additional assistance is required, and they will happily do this.  The bottom line I think is that its too easy to throw in the towel when roadblocks come up.  Its too easy to come to a dead end and just go ask some one to help me solve this, instead of trying to think through the problem for a sulution.  This has thus far been the underlying focus of OCS, the focus on a different way of thinking, thinking algorythmically.  Sounds fancy, almost snotty, but I love it.
