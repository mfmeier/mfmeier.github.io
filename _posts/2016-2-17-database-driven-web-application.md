title: Components of a databse driven web application

What are Models, Controllers, and views?  When creating a databse driven web application in Ruby, certain elements are required for functionality.  The 'model' in said application looks like the format of a 'class'.  The definition of this model includes whatever 'rules' or methods used to maintain the database.  It is through this element that if nothing else, we have used the powers of 'Active Record'(which we passed its knowledge to all models in the database) to perform basic functions on and about the database.  We also use this element to create our own methods to make the database maintainable.  Names for columns in other tables can be shared to make the display user friendly, and values can be shared via methods in the model.  The 'controllers' are used to route user input (via links and forms) to where given information is requested.  The controllers are basically the 'director' of the application, everything from the user side is told what to do by them.  'Views' are the pages the controller directs users to, to give them the information they requested.
