title: Experiences Feelings and Advice to Week 3
---
well, I dont know about advice going into week 3, but I sure do have some experiences and a couple of feelings.  We have now covered a pretty healthy sample of Ruby in our studies and projects, have covered and completed several challenging problems that involve some of the basics of programming.  Despite some concepts escaping me initially, I am gaining confidence every day not only in my ability to continue this curiculum, but in my ability to retain the information and apply it.  Like I said, not everything clicked right away, but it didnt take long for me to grasp inportant concepts and apply them to different projects.  

This week we are going to switch gears a little bit and I am ready for that.  Not that I am done with Ruby or any other fully functional programming language, but learning something a bit different will be welcome after being imersed into Ruby methods for two weeks.  We briefly touched on html, and discovered ways for Ruby to help html in website functionality, which is really gratifying because we can now see applications for a variety of things we have already learned.  

With so much left of the curiculum left to go its hard to know much of what we are going to be doing or when.  I am able to say however that both my confidence and excitement to continue keeps rising as the course goes on, and I'm excited to see whats going to happen next and takle it!
